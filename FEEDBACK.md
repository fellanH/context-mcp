# Feedback

Real observations from using the product. Primary input for roadmap direction.

**To add feedback:** `feedback: [what you experienced or noticed]`
Agent appends it here and returns to whatever was in progress.

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD [UX/DEV] — [observation]`
Tag: `[UX]` = user experience, `[DEV]` = developer experience

**Processed at triage** — agents translate entries into scored backlog items.
